This preprint identifies optimal materials for realizing TET--CVTL topological saturation in laboratory settings, enabling ultraclean turbulence (Re → ∞), eternal anyonic braiding, and applications in aneutronic fusion and vacuum torque devices.

Key materials:
- Graphene/hBN heterostructures for room-temperature ultraclean turbulence
- Superfluid helium-4 (He-II) as de Sitter analog medium
- Diamond (CVD) for indestructible structural containment

A comparison table and experimental guidelines are provided.
